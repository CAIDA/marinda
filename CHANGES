version 0.8.0, 2009-03-16
  * added documentation: Installation and Client Programming Guides

    other general improvements
  * added license text to source files in preparation for public release

version 0.7.3, 2009-02-27

version 0.7.0, 2008-08-01
  * implemented checkpointing and restore in global tuple space
  * changed mux-demux protocol (now v2) to exchange node ID and session ID;
    this allows both the local and global servers to properly handle failure
    of either end

    with much better checking of config files

    fixed bugs, etc.

version 0.6.4, 2008-03-11
  * changed TemplateBag to provide newly written tuples to all suitable
    blocked *read* requests before providing tuples to blocked take requests;
    previously, take requests took precedence, and it was impossible to write
    a program that monitored all tuples (for logging purposes, for example)
